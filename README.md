# All About Britney

- I tried making a site with a myriad of different elements.
    - images
    - videos
    - forms
- I had difficulty centering things
- I wish I could have made it fancier but it literally took an entire day to get it centered

- Are we supposed to choose color schemes? Because I must've inherited my father's colorblindness.
- I also chose Britney because, well, it's Britney.
