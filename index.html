        For most Millennials, we've hit a point in our lives where we've said more times than we'd like to admit, 
      <q>Wow, they really don't make music like that anymore. What a shame</q>
      Music has always had the power to transport us to a memory filled with excitement or 
      nostalgia. For me, I'm usually taken back to a time of youthful and blissful ignorance.
      When the only thing I had to worry about was handing over the right Whitney Houston cassette 
      to my big sister or wondering where I too can find some peaches and cream. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        From this loverly era of music, pop culture has been blessed with some undeniable and larger-than-life 
      pop icons. We got hits about not dealing scrubs and rocking boats. We got some bangers that went on to 
      define several artists around the world. But arguably, not a single recording artist has the same level of
      global influence on culture, art, and femininity (dare I say, <i>female empowerment</i>) in music as the one and only Britney Spears.

          In 1998, at just 16 years old, Britney blessed us with her first single <q>...Baby One More Time</q>
        This song was everywhere and even 22 years later will still force us all to sing along, begrudingly or willingly. 
        But apart from her new segue into musical immortality, she began a pop culture movement that is still going strong today. 
        </p>
    
         <p>At 16 years old, Britney was molded and personified as a sex symbol. This was evident in her musical lyrics, musical performances, and press.

        Today, we're bombarded with sex and sexual images in everyday life. But, can we really explicitily say <q>today?</q>
        Sexual expression has developed over time and especially explosive since the sexual and womens liberations in the 1960's. 
        Since then we've had numerous sex icons, ranging from Farrah Fawecet to Megan Fox, Phoebe Cates to Halle Berry. (And, I guess some newer women but I honestly cannot keep track of.)
        When Brooke Shields, as a minor <b>i.e., 10 years old</b> was photographed <i>nude</i>, nothing happened. Some things probably happened but 
        nothing concrete because it obviously failed to set a precedent. <a href=# french netflix movie></a>
        </p>

        <p>
          But back to Britney... so at 16 years old, we, as a society (and her legal guardians but that's also beyond the scope of this), allowed her to be idolized in such a sexual manner. Why?
        Because sex sells, regardless of any possible amorality. Combine her oversexualized persona ala Lolita 
        with the Judeo-Christion ideology our legal and moral system is based on, and it results in a very capricious, very fickle love-hate relationship.
        </p> 
        <p>
          So is it really inconceivable or surprising that while Britney was giving us timeless hits, giving us album after album, tour after tour that she would have a break down? 
        Not only was she dealing with the pressures involved of having a mega-star career that was almost entirely based on her physical apperance, she was still growing up. 
        Who wouldn't break? I, personally, have had worse breakdowns with signicantly less stress. So all that led to:

        <br>
        <p>But whatever, big whoop. Who hasn't given themselves a rough haircut on a whim? Or had a Vegas Wedding? Or had a breakdown
        because people literally wouldn't leave you alone? Well,it actually was a big whoop because as a result of that very public breakdown (keyword= public), she was stripped of
        her autonomy and placed under a conservatorship. Meaning, even though she was still able to have her career and have her children, she had a legal guardian. 
        Her legal guardian, her lovely father, has had control of her wealth and decision-making since then.
        </p>
        <p>For all intents and purposes, Britney reacted to her circumstance the same way any other 26 year old would've. Yet, she always pretty much
        demonized for what she did. Not fair but not uncommon. Similar things have happened to notable women in Hollywood and they either never regained what they lost
        or it was a struggle. (This is also a decent representaton of double-standards permeating through this industry. Several, several, numerous, a seemingly endless supply
        of male actors/celebritites/athletes have still managed to sustain healthy and economincal profitable careers despite of similar breakdowns or legitmatiely amoral acts. I digress as it falls 
        beyond the purview of the fansite.)
        <br>
        <h3> Stronger Than Yesterday</h3>
        Since her breakdown, she has released four (4) studio albums.

        And recently, we've had the #FreeBritney movement. So kudos on her for standing up for herself and advocating for her autnomomy.

        <h3> 
          What has Ms. Britney Spears taught us?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Now, I am not going to say that Britney was the only reason women have been able to own their sexualities and femininity because we have 
          a couple women that came before her and owned their bodies. Think Cher in <i>If I Could Turn Back Time sourrounded by sailors.</i> 
          Think Madonna in a whole bunch of stuff, like her Blonde Ambition Tour. But, even if you think to the other women in her "class," like Christina and 
          some others that didn't reach their level of stardom, like Jessica Simpson and Mandy Moore, there was just something about Brit.
          Now, I wasn't alive for those so I won't be able to neither fully understand nor attest to the implications of Cher wearing a thong under a fishnet body suit (classic, btw).
          But I think Britney just happened to have the right timing and age to blowup like she did. Then she really did work hard to keep it going. Sadly
          it resulted in a bit of a mental health crisis. No shame in that. She was able to bounce back with her career and I guess, raise her kids.    
          She could be considered a role model for many people.
